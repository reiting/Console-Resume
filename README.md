# S17-Lab1
# Lab 01: A Modern & Retro Resume

##### Covalence

###### Full Stack: Spring 2017

## Objectives

* You will create a resume using JavaScript (modern), but it will be plain text and not graphical (retro).

* You will create a folder, and inside that folder an index.html file and a javascript file.

* Your "resume" will simply be a series of `console.log` statements to print the resume data to the console.

* When you open index.html in the browser, it will be a blank page. That's okay. Your resume will be in the console. (`command + option + I`)

* Your resume should display the following information:

* Your name

* Your career/field

* A short description of yourself

* A list of your interests

* A list of your past positions that includes company/place name, title, short description of what you did

* A list of your skills

* You can make up information if you'd like

* In your skill list, skills that are "cool" should begin with `Check It:`

## Additional Requirements

* You may use console.log to print the data to the console as you see fit, except as specified in these requirements.

* Your name should print in all capital letters, but you must not type it as all capitalized in your code (i.e. you will need to use JavaScript to capitalize it)

* You must have a function called `displayPosition` that takes parameters for company name, job title, and description. The function should `console.log` those three items in a format similar to the example below. You will call `displayPosition` several times with different data.

* You must have a function called `displaySkill` that takes parameters for skill name and a boolean value for whether the skill is cool (true/false). Inside the function, you should print `Check It:` in front of the skill name only if the skill is cool. If you are not sure if a skill is cool, or if you do not have any cool skills, raise your hand and I will render assistance.

## Example Output

Your resume output should look similar to this:
